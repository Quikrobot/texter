Send quick SMS responses from your Pebble. (Android only)

Navigation
------------

The app uses a navigation system whereby the action in bold is performed on a single click and the action not in bold is performed on a long press of the key. The back button returns you to the previous list.

How to Use
--------------

When the app is launched you are given the option to message either the last person who you had a conversation with or the first person in your favourite list. A long press on either takes you to a list of 6.

You can then navigate the tree of messages which you can customise on the companion app. Anything prefixed with a + means it is a sub menu. Anything else is a message that when you click will send the relevant message to the person you selected.
